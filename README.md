Project Idea: My project idea is a wellness app which is on the topic mental and physical wellbeing. This app contains different wellness activity guides and is connect to the theme "Healthcare". We will have a menu bar which consists of Spas, Fitness Training Studios, Ayurvedic companies, Therapists, Dieticians, Counsellors and Pharmacies. We will either be using the help of custom google maps or just regular JSX and JavaScript language. We will be using google maps for Spas, Fitness training studios and Pharmacies. For Therapists, Dieticians, Ayurvedic Companies and Counsellors, we will be giving their contact details. We will tie up with the same in the future, for the benefit of our customers in terms of certain offers. For the time being, this app is limited only to Citizens of Hyderabad, but we plan to expand it throughout India in the future as there goes a lot of fieldwork.
